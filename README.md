# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

## Highlights
- Feature engineering using domain knowledge (titles, family structure, cabin information)
- Regularized Logistic Regression and Random Forest modeling
- Evaluation using cross-validated ROC-AUC
- Threshold analysis and decision-oriented evaluation
- Clean Kaggle submission workflow

## Files
- `Titanic-Final1.ipynb` — complete notebook with analysis and modeling

## Notes
This project emphasizes methodology, interpretability, and generalization over leaderboard optimization.
